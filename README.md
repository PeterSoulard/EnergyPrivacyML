# SCORE: Synthesis Cost and Output Returns Evaluator

This is a framework for evaluating the energy consumption of machine learning data synthesizers against their returns in terms of privacy, fidelity and utility. 

## Running the experiments

To run the experiments as is, select the synthesizer of choice by changing the import in the main function.

## Adding a new synthesizer

To add a new synthesizer, copy the file `custom_synthesizer.py`, import the Python library and implement the generating function as per the instructions.
